Discussion Issues:
(1)Flipping room while keeping player and gravity direction constantly "down" vs (2)flipping player and gravity direction while keeping room constant
	-Ideally, would be (1), but if it is too complicated, then do (2)
	-For up-down rotation, delta y from the midline becomes negative delta y
	-For left right rotation, delta x from the midline becomes negative delta x
	-For 90 degree rotation, delta y becomes negative delta x and delta x becomes delta y or vice versa

Programming Schedule:
1 - Pyayer falls in a single graviational frame, player can not fall through platform
2 - Player has basic movement - move, jump, etc
3 - Add hazard functionality (Spikes, lava, energy ball)
4 - Start basic level design, add overlay
5 - Add up-down flippble fuctionality
6 - Make an up-down flippable level design
7 - Add left-up gravity functionality
8 - Add right-down gravity functionality and begin on perpendicular gravity level
9 - Finish perpendicular gravity level
10 - Add map switching mechanic, make more levels
11 - Debugging and more levels
12 - Finishing touches and trophies
