Discussion Issues:
(1)Flipping room while keeping player and gravity direction constantly "down" vs (2)flipping player and gravity direction while keeping room constant
	-Ideally, would be (1), but if it is too complicated, then do (2)
	-For up-down rotation, delta y from the midline becomes negative delta y
	-For left right rotation, delta x from the midline becomes negative delta x
	-For 90 degree rotation, delta y becomes negative delta x and delta x becomes delta y or vice versa

Programming Schedule:
1 - Player falls with an acceleration under gravity in a single graviational frame, create a platform that the player collides with and can stand on (handleGrav(p) in tech spec)
2 - Player has basic movement - move, jump, etc (controls in design document)
3 - Add hazard and damage functionality (enemy interaction in design document)
4 - Start basic level design, add overlay (sample level design and overlay in design document)
5 - Add up-down flippble fuctionality (Gravity in design document)
6 - Make an up-down flippable level design (sample level design in design document)
7 - Add left-up gravity functionality (discussion issues in 12day)
8 - Add right-down gravity functionality and begin on perpendicular gravity level (discussion issues in 12day and sample level design in design document)
9 - Finish perpendicular gravity level (sample level design in design document)
10 - Add map switching mechanic, make more levels (exit in tech spec)
11 - Debugging and more levels (sample level design in design document)
12 - Finishing touches and trophies (secondary objective in design document)
